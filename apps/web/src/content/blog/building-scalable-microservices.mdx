Microservices architecture has become the de facto standard for building modern, scalable applications. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore how to leverage Telos to build, deploy, and manage microservices effectively.

<InfoBox type='info' title="What You'll Learn">

- Microservices architecture fundamentals
- Service design patterns
- API Gateway integration
- Service discovery and communication
- Monitoring and observability

</InfoBox>

## Why Microservices?

Microservices offer several compelling advantages over monolithic architectures:

- **Scalability**: Scale individual services independently based on demand
- **Flexibility**: Use different technologies for different services
- **Resilience**: Isolate failures to individual services
- **Development Speed**: Teams can work independently on different services
- **Deployment**: Deploy services independently without affecting the entire system

## Core Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility

Each microservice should focus on a single business capability:

```typescript
// Good: User Service handles only user-related operations
class UserService {
  async createUser(userData) {...}
  async getUserById(id) {...}
  async updateUser(id, data) {...}
  async deleteUser(id) {...}
}
```

### 2. Loose Coupling

Services should be independent and communicate through well-defined interfaces:

<InfoBox type='note'>

Use asynchronous messaging and event-driven patterns to reduce coupling between services.

</InfoBox>

### 3. API First Design

Design your APIs before implementing services:

```typescript
// API Contract Example
interface OrderAPI {
  POST / orders: CreateOrder
  GET / orders /: id: GetOrder
  PUT / orders /: id: UpdateOrder
  DELETE / orders /: id: CancelOrder
}
```

## Service Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication

Using REST APIs or gRPC for request-response patterns:

```typescript
const response = await fetch('https://api.telos.com/users/123', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
  },
})
```

### Asynchronous Communication

Using message queues for event-driven architecture:

<InfoBox type='info' title='Event-Driven Benefits'>

Asynchronous communication improves resilience and allows services to process events at their own pace.

</InfoBox>

## API Gateway Integration

<BlogImage

  alt='Network and API connections visualization'

/>

Telos API Gateway provides a unified entry point for all your microservices:

**Key Features:**

- Request routing and load balancing
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Request/response transformation
- Caching and performance optimization

```typescript
// API Gateway Configuration
const gatewayConfig = {
  routes: [
    {
      path: '/api/users/*',
      target: 'user-service:8080',
      rateLimit: 1000,
    },
    {
      path: '/api/orders/*',
      target: 'order-service:8080',
      rateLimit: 500,
    },
  ],
}
```

## Data Management

### Database Per Service

Each microservice should own its data:

<InfoBox type='warning' title='Important'>

Never share databases between services. This creates tight coupling and defeats the purpose of microservices.

</InfoBox>

### Data Consistency

Use eventual consistency and saga patterns for distributed transactions:

1. **Orchestration**: Central coordinator manages the transaction
2. **Choreography**: Services coordinate through events

## Monitoring and Observability

### Distributed Tracing

Track requests across multiple services:

```typescript
// Add correlation IDs to track requests
const correlationId = generateId()
headers['X-Correlation-ID'] = correlationId
```

### Centralized Logging

Aggregate logs from all services:

- Use structured logging
- Include correlation IDs
- Log service name and version
- Track request/response times

### Health Checks

Implement health check endpoints:

```typescript
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    status: 'healthy',
    timestamp: new Date(),
    dependencies: {
      database: 'connected',
      cache: 'connected',
    },
  })
})
```

## Deployment Strategies

### Container-Based Deployment

Use Docker for consistent deployment:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --production
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

### Rolling Updates

Deploy new versions without downtime:

1. Deploy new version alongside old
2. Gradually shift traffic to new version
3. Monitor for issues
4. Complete rollout or rollback if needed

<InfoBox type='info' title='Zero Downtime'>

Always use rolling updates or blue-green deployments to ensure zero downtime.

</InfoBox>

## Security Best Practices

### Service-to-Service Authentication

Use mutual TLS or JWT tokens:

```typescript
const token = jwt.sign(
  {
    serviceId: 'order-service',
    scope: ['read:users'],
  },
  SECRET_KEY,
  { expiresIn: '1h' }
)
```

### API Security

- Always use HTTPS
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate all inputs
- Use API keys for external access
- Implement proper CORS policies

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Creating Too Many Services

Start with a modular monolith and extract services as needed.

### 2. Chatty Services

Avoid excessive inter-service communication:

- ❌ Making 10 API calls to render one page
- ✅ Aggregate data at the API Gateway level

### 3. Ignoring Network Failures

Always implement retry logic and circuit breakers:

<InfoBox type='warning'>

Network failures are inevitable in distributed systems. Plan for them from the start.

</InfoBox>

## Conclusion

Building scalable microservices requires careful planning and adherence to best practices. Telos provides the tools and infrastructure to make microservices development easier and more efficient.

Start small, focus on business capabilities, and iterate based on real-world needs.
