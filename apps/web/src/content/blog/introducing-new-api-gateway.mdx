We're excited to announce the release of our completely redesigned API Gateway! After months of development and extensive beta testing, we're ready to bring you a faster, more powerful, and easier-to-use gateway.

<InfoBox type='info' title='Key Highlights'>

- 3x faster request processing
- Advanced routing capabilities
- Built-in rate limiting and caching
- Enhanced security features
- Improved monitoring and analytics

</InfoBox>

## What's New?

### Performance Improvements

Our new API Gateway is built from the ground up with performance in mind:

- **3x Faster**: Average response time reduced from 150ms to 50ms
- **Higher Throughput**: Handle up to 100,000 requests per second
- **Lower Latency**: Edge caching reduces latency by up to 80%

```typescript
// Performance metrics comparison
const metrics = {
  old: { avgResponseTime: '150ms', maxThroughput: '30k/s' },
  new: { avgResponseTime: '50ms', maxThroughput: '100k/s' },
}
```

### Advanced Routing

More flexible and powerful routing options:

**Path-based Routing:**

```typescript
{
  path: '/api/v2/users/*',
  target: 'user-service-v2',
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE']
}
```

**Header-based Routing:**

```typescript
{
  path: '/api/users/*',
  target: 'user-service-beta',
  conditions: {
    headers: { 'X-Beta-User': 'true' }
  }
}
```

**Weight-based Routing:**

Perfect for canary deployments:

```typescript
{
  path: '/api/orders/*',
  targets: [
    { service: 'orders-v1', weight: 90 },
    { service: 'orders-v2', weight: 10 }
  ]
}
```

### Built-in Rate Limiting

Protect your services with intelligent rate limiting:

<InfoBox type='info' title='Multiple Strategies'>

Choose from fixed window, sliding window, or token bucket algorithms.

</InfoBox>

```typescript
const rateLimit = {
  strategy: 'sliding-window',
  limit: 1000,
  window: '1m',
  keyBy: 'ip', // or 'user', 'api-key'
}
```

### Response Caching

Reduce backend load with smart caching:

```typescript
const cacheConfig = {
  enabled: true,
  ttl: 300, // 5 minutes
  varyBy: ['query', 'headers.accept-language'],
  exclude: ['/api/auth/*', '/api/admin/*'],
}
```

## Enhanced Security

### Authentication Methods

Support for multiple authentication schemes:

- API Keys
- OAuth 2.0
- JWT Tokens
- Mutual TLS
- Custom authentication plugins

### Request Validation

Automatically validate requests against schemas:

```typescript
const validation = {
  enabled: true,
  schema: {
    body: {
      type: 'object',
      required: ['email', 'name'],
      properties: {
        email: { type: 'string', format: 'email' },
        name: { type: 'string', minLength: 2 },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

<InfoBox type='warning' title='Security First'>

All requests are validated and sanitized before reaching your backend services.

</InfoBox>

## Developer Experience

### Real-time Monitoring

New dashboard with real-time insights:

- Request volume and latency
- Error rates and types
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Top endpoints and consumers
- Geographic distribution

### API Documentation

Auto-generated, always up-to-date documentation:

```typescript
// OpenAPI 3.0 support
export const openAPIConfig = {
  version: '3.0.0',
  info: {
    title: 'Telos API',
    version: '2.0.0',
  },
  autoGenerate: true,
}
```

### Testing Tools

Built-in API testing and debugging:

- Request/response inspector
- Mock responses for testing
- Load testing capabilities
- API playground

## Migration Guide

### Step 1: Review Configuration

Export your current gateway configuration:

```bash
telos gateway export --output config.json
```

### Step 2: Update Routes

The new routing syntax is more powerful but slightly different:

```typescript
// Old syntax
{
  route: '/users',
  service: 'user-service'
}

// New syntax
{
  path: '/users/*',
  target: 'user-service',
  version: 'v2'
}
```

### Step 3: Test in Staging

Deploy to staging environment first:

```bash
telos gateway deploy --env staging --config new-config.json
```

### Step 4: Gradual Rollout

Use traffic splitting for safe migration:

<InfoBox type='info' title='Zero Downtime'>

Run old and new gateways in parallel during migration for zero downtime.

</InfoBox>

## Pricing

The new API Gateway is available at the same price:

- **Free Tier**: Up to 1M requests/month
- **Pro**: $49/month for 10M requests
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing for high volume

## What's Next?

We're already working on the next set of features:

- GraphQL support
- WebSocket proxying
- Advanced analytics and insights
- Plugin marketplace
- Multi-region deployment
