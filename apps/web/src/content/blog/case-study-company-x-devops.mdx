Company X, a fast-growing SaaS company with 50+ engineers, was struggling with slow and error-prone deployments. Their manual deployment process was taking hours and often resulted in production issues. Here's how they used Telos to transform their DevOps pipeline.

<InfoBox type='info' title='Key Results'>

- 75% reduction in deployment time
- 90% fewer deployment errors
- 100% deployment automation
- 50% reduction in DevOps team workload

</InfoBox>

## The Challenge

### Before Telos

Company X's deployment process was a nightmare:

- **Manual Steps**: 15+ manual steps per deployment
- **Long Duration**: 4-6 hours for a full deployment
- **High Error Rate**: 25% of deployments required rollback
- **Limited Visibility**: No centralized monitoring
- **Team Burnout**: DevOps team working nights and weekends

### Pain Points

```typescript
// Their manual deployment checklist
const deploymentSteps = [
  'Run tests locally',
  'Build Docker images',
  'Tag images manually',
  'Update Kubernetes manifests',
  'Apply manifests one by one',
  'Monitor logs manually',
  'Update database schemas',
  'Run migration scripts',
  'Verify deployment manually',
  'Update documentation',
  'Notify team',
  'Monitor for issues',
]
```

<InfoBox type='warning' title='The Breaking Point'>

A critical deployment failure during peak hours cost them $50,000 in lost revenue and damaged customer trust.

</InfoBox>

## The Solution

### Phase 1: Automated CI/CD Pipeline

First, they automated their build and test process:

```typescript
// Automated CI/CD workflow
const cicdWorkflow = {
  name: 'Build and Deploy',
  trigger: {
    type: 'git_push',
    branch: 'main',
  },
  steps: [
    {
      name: 'Run Tests',
      action: 'run_tests',
      config: {
        command: 'npm test',
        coverage: true,
      },
    },
    {
      name: 'Build Images',
      action: 'docker_build',
      config: {
        tags: ['${GIT_COMMIT}', 'latest'],
      },
    },
    {
      name: 'Push to Registry',
      action: 'docker_push',
      config: {
        registry: 'company-x-registry',
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

### Phase 2: Automated Deployment

Next, they automated the deployment process:

**Staging Environment:**

```typescript
const stagingDeploy = {
  name: 'Deploy to Staging',
  trigger: {
    type: 'workflow_complete',
    workflow: 'Build and Deploy',
  },
  steps: [
    {
      name: 'Update K8s Manifests',
      action: 'kubectl_apply',
      config: {
        environment: 'staging',
        namespace: 'company-x-staging',
      },
    },
    {
      name: 'Run Smoke Tests',
      action: 'run_tests',
      config: {
        suite: 'smoke',
        environment: 'staging',
      },
    },
    {
      name: 'Notify Team',
      action: 'slack_notify',
      config: {
        channel: '#deployments',
        message: 'Staging deployment complete âœ…',
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

**Production Environment:**

```typescript
const prodDeploy = {
  name: 'Deploy to Production',
  trigger: {
    type: 'manual_approval',
    approvers: ['devops-team'],
  },
  steps: [
    {
      name: 'Database Migration',
      action: 'run_migration',
      config: {
        direction: 'up',
        dryRun: true,
      },
    },
    {
      name: 'Rolling Update',
      action: 'kubectl_rollout',
      config: {
        strategy: 'rolling',
        maxSurge: '25%',
        maxUnavailable: '0',
      },
    },
    {
      name: 'Health Check',
      action: 'health_check',
      config: {
        endpoint: '/health',
        retries: 5,
        interval: 10,
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

### Phase 3: Monitoring and Alerting

Finally, they implemented comprehensive monitoring:

<InfoBox type='info' title='Real-time Monitoring'>

All deployments are monitored in real-time with automatic rollback on failures.

</InfoBox>

```typescript
const monitoring = {
  name: 'Production Monitoring',
  checks: [
    {
      metric: 'error_rate',
      threshold: 1, // 1%
      action: 'rollback',
    },
    {
      metric: 'response_time',
      threshold: 500, // 500ms
      action: 'alert',
    },
    {
      metric: 'cpu_usage',
      threshold: 80, // 80%
      action: 'scale_up',
    },
  ],
}
```

3. **Team Buy-in**: Involved entire team in planning
4. **Documentation**: Maintained clear documentation throughout

### Challenges Faced

1. **Legacy Systems**: Some old services needed refactoring
2. **Learning Curve**: Team needed time to adapt
3. **Edge Cases**: Discovered unique scenarios requiring special handling

### Best Practices Adopted

```typescript
// Deployment best practices
const bestPractices = {
  alwaysUseVersionTags: true,
  implementHealthChecks: true,
  enableAutomaticRollback: true,
  maintainDeploymentLogs: true,
  requireCodeReview: true,
  runAutomatedTests: true,
  useFeatureFlags: true,

}
```

## Advice for Others

### For Companies Considering Automation

<InfoBox type='info' title='Start Today'>

The best time to automate was yesterday. The second best time is today.

</InfoBox>

**Key Recommendations:**

1. **Measure First**: Document current process and metrics
2. **Start Simple**: Automate one workflow at a time
3. **Get Buy-in**: Involve stakeholders early
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Test automation in staging first
5. **Monitor Everything**: Set up monitoring from day one
6. **Iterate**: Continuously improve based on feedback

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don't try to automate everything at once
- Don't skip testing phases
- Don't ignore edge cases
- Don't forget about monitoring
- Don't underestimate training needs

## What's Next for Company X

Company X continues to expand their automation:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Automating infrastructure provisioning
